The satellite is built on Orbital ATKs GEOStar-2e bus and carries 35 equivalent 36 MHz Ku-band transponders connected to three service areas. Switchable transponders will also increase commercial flexibility.\n\nCo-passenger on this flight will be provided Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.

After successfully completing a series of in-orbit tests, the MEV-1 will begin its mission extension service for Intelsat-901 satellite in the graveyard orbit. MEV-1 will relocate the satellite scheduled for the mission extension service, which is planned for a five-year period, after which Intelsat 901 will be place back into graveyard orbit. Intelsat will also have the option to service multiple satellites using the same MEV.\n\nMEV-1 is based on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GEOStar-3 spacecraft bus platform. Controlled by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite operations team, the MEV-1 uses a reliable, low-risk docking system that attaches to existing features on a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite.

Konnect & GSAT-30", "description": "Eutelsat Konnect is an all-electric, Ka-band geostationary communications satellite built by Thales Alenia Space for Eutelsat. It will provide broadband services to users in Africa and Europe.  The baseline mission of the satellite is to provide 75 Gbps of capacity across a network of 65 spotbeams that together provide quasi-complete coverage of Sub-Saharan Africa. The satellite will address direct-to-user consumer and enterprise broadband services using dishes from approximately 75 cm. It will also be used for community networks connected to Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile phone backhauling and rural connectivity.\r\nEutelsat Konnect is the first to use Thales Alenia Space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-electric Spacebus NEO platform, developed under the Neosat Partnership Project conducted by the European and French space agencies (ESA and CNES). More robust, more modular, more powerful, more innovative, more flexible, this platform is perfectly adapted to operators' expectations in the evolving telecommunication market, and particlularly well positioned for very demanding VHTS missions. Eutelsat Konnect will allow the in-orbit validation of the complete end-to-end system of the new Spacebus Neo product line, including the fully-electric orbit-raising phase\r\n\r\nGSAT-30 is a telecommunications satellite designed and manufactured  by  ISRO. To be positioned at a longitude  of  83\u00c2\u00b0 East, it will provide high-quality television, telecommunications and broadcasting services over Indian mainland and Islands. \r\nGSAT-30 is configured on ISRO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enhanced I-3K platform to provide communications services from geostationary orbit in C-and Ku-band for a lifetime greater than 15 years. By operating GSAT-30, ISRO will once again foster the use of space to help bridge the digital divide in the Indian subcontinent as part of its ambitious space program.
