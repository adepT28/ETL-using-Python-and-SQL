This will be China's first mission to Mars. \n\nThe spacecraft will reach Mars in February 2021. Lander will remain attached to the orbiter for two to three months before attempting its landing. The chosen landing area is Utopia Planitia, a huge basin formed by a large impact far back in Mars' history. The rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.\n\nThe orbiter will operate in a polar orbit in order to  map Mars' morphology and geological structure while also using the Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar instrument to investigate soil characteristics and water-ice distribution. It will also measure the ionosphere and the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the new paper reported. The rover will have 13 instruments detecting things such as topography, soil, environment, atmosphere, water ice, physical field and internal structure. It will investigate the surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution with its own Subsurface Exploration Radar. It will also analyze surface material composition and characteristics of the Martian climate and environment on the surface.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Robotic Exploration", "orbit": {"id": 6, "name": "Heliocentric N/A", "abbrev": "Helio-N/A"}}, "pad": {"id": 78, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/78/", "agency_id": null, "name": "Wenchang", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps?q=19.614354,110.951057", "latitude": "19.614354", "longitude": "110.951057", "location": {"id": 8, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/8/", "name": "Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, People's Republic of China", "country_code": "CHN", "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_8_20200803142445.jpg", "timezone_name": "Asia/Shanghai", "total_launch_count": 22, "total_landing_count": 0}, "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_78_20200803143548.jpg", "total_launch_count": 16, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 16}, "webcast_live": false, "image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/long2520march25205_image_20191228095452.jpg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 5968, "location_launch_attempt_count": 8, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 8, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 288, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 55, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 3, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 3, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 17}, {"id": "c7f03e53-e4e3-42e3-9d57-71666ad80c18", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/c7f03e53-e4e3-42e3-9d57-71666ad80c18/", "slug": "soyuz-21a-progress-ms-15-76p", "name": "Soyuz 2.1a | Progress MS-15 (76P)", "status": {"id": 3, "name": "Launch Successful", "abbrev": "Success", "description": "The launch vehicle successfully inserted its payload(s) into the target orbit(s)."}, "last_updated": "2023-01-21T01:06:42Z", "net": "2020-07-23T14:26:22Z", "window_end": "2020-07-23T14:26:22Z", "window_start": "2020-07-23T14:26:22Z", "probability": -1, "holdreason": null, "failreason": null, "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 63, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/", "name": "Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)", "type": "Government"}, "rocket": {"id": 2535, "configuration": {"id": 24, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/24/", "name": "Soyuz 2.1a", "family": "Soyuz", "full_name": "Soyuz 2.1a", "variant": ""}}, "mission": {"id": 1128, "name": "Progress MS-15 (76P)", "description": "The Progress resupply vehicle is an automated, unpiloted version of the Soyuz spacecraft that is used to bring supplies and fuel to the International Space Station.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Resupply", "orbit": {"id": 8, "name": "Low Earth Orbit", "abbrev": "LEO"}}, "pad": {"id": 20, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/20/", "agency_id": null, "name": "31/6", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_31", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps?q=45.996034,63.564003", "latitude": "45.996034", "longitude": "63.564003", "location": {"id": 15, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/15/", "name": "Baikonur Cosmodrome, Republic of Kazakhstan", "country_code": "KAZ", "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_15_20200803142517.jpg", "timezone_name": "Asia/Qyzylorda", "total_launch_count": 1540, "total_landing_count": 0}, "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_20_20200803143516.jpg", "total_launch_count": 407, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 407}, "webcast_live": false, "image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_2.1a_image_20201013143850.jpg", "infographic": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/soyuz25202.1a_infographic_20200723132740.png", "program": [{"id": 17, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/17/", "name": "International Space Station", "description": "The International Space Station programme is tied together by a complex set of legal, political and financial agreements between the sixteen nations involved in the project, governing ownership of the various components, rights to crewing and utilization, and responsibilities for crew rotation and resupply of the International Space Station.
