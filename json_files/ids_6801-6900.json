Roman objectives include a search for extra-solar planets using gravitational microlensing, and probing the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of cosmic structure, with the goal of measuring the effects of dark energy, the consistency of general relativity, and the curvature of spacetime.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Astrophysics", "orbit": {"id": 16, "name": "Sun-Earth L2", "abbrev": "L2"}}, "pad": {"id": 87, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/87/", "agency_id": null, "name": "Launch Complex 39A", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39#Launch_Pad_39A", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.60822681,-80.60428186", "latitude": "28.60822681", "longitude": "-80.60428186", "location": {"id": 27, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/27/", "name": "Kennedy Space Center, FL, USA", "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_27_20200803142447.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/New_York", "total_launch_count": 217, "total_landing_count": 0}, "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_87_20200803143537.jpg", "total_launch_count": 159, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 158}, "webcast_live": false, "image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/falcon_heavy_image_20220129192819.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6666, "location_launch_attempt_count": 247, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 186, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 326, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 9, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 4, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 4, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 4}, {"id": "bf2c3027-a314-403e-a416-2bfd5d165ad1", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/bf2c3027-a314-403e-a416-2bfd5d165ad1/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-dragon-crs-2-spx-35", "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Dragon CRS-2 SpX-35", "status": {"id": 2, "name": "To Be Determined", "abbrev": "TBD", "description": "Current date is a placeholder or rough estimation based on unreliable or interpreted sources."}, "last_updated": "2023-01-21T01:04:18Z", "net": "2026-10-31T00:00:00Z", "window_end": "2026-10-31T00:00:00Z", "window_start": "2026-10-31T00:00:00Z", "probability": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}, "rocket": {"id": 7748, "configuration": {"id": 164, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/", "name": "Falcon 9", "family": "Falcon", "full_name": "Falcon 9 Block 5", "variant": "Block 5"}}, "mission": {"id": 6266, "name": "Dragon CRS-2 SpX-35", "description": "35th commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station operated by SpaceX.

The primary objective is to land the rover at a site with high potential for finding well-preserved organic material, particularly from the very early history of the planet. The rover is expected to travel several kilometers during its mission. \n\nThe European rover will be the first mission to combine the capability to move across the surface and to study Mars at depth. It will collect samples with a drill down to a depth of 2 m and analyze them with next-generation instruments in an onboard laboratory. Underground samples are more likely to include biomarkers, since the tenuous martian atmosphere offers little protection from radiation and photochemistry at the surface. \n\nWhile the rover will drive away from the surface platform to perform scientific investigations within several kilometers of the landing site, the Russian-made platform will remain stationary and will investigate the local surface environment for its normal mission lifetime of one Earth year. The main science priorities for the platform are context imaging of the landing site, long-term climate monitoring, and atmospheric investigations. Sensors and instruments will also study the subsurface water distribution at the landing site, investigate the exchange of volatiles between the atmosphere and the surface, monitor the radiation environment and compare it with measurements made with the radiation dosimeter on the Trace Gas Orbiter, and carry out geophysical investigations of the planet's internal structure.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Robotic Exploration", "orbit": {"id": 6, "name": "Heliocentric N/A", "abbrev": "Helio-N/A"}}, "pad": {"id": 15, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/15/", "agency_id": null, "name": "200/39 (200L)", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps?q=46.039984,63.032093", "latitude": "46.039984", "longitude": "63.032093", "location": {"id": 15, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/15/", "name": "Baikonur Cosmodrome, Republic of Kazakhstan", "country_code": "KAZ", "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_15_20200803142517.jpg", "timezone_name": "Asia/Qyzylorda", "total_launch_count": 1540, "total_landing_count": 0}, "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_15_20200803143530.jpg", "total_launch_count": 167, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 167}, "webcast_live": false, "image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/proton-m2520briz-m_image_20190224012317.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6676, "location_launch_attempt_count": 1550, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 168, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 197, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 6, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 1, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 1, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 1}, {"id": "862b54e3-7bf8-48e5-8cd1-d77257d5fde9", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/862b54e3-7bf8-48e5-8cd1-d77257d5fde9/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-crew-12", "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Crew-12", "status": {"id": 2, "name": "To Be Determined", "abbrev": "TBD", "description": "Current date is a placeholder or rough estimation based on unreliable or interpreted sources."}, "last_updated": "2023-01-21T00:49:37Z", "net": "2029-03-31T00:00:00Z", "window_end": "2029-03-31T00:00:00Z", "window_start": "2029-03-31T00:00:00Z", "probability": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}, "rocket": {"id": 7599, "configuration": {"id": 164, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/", "name": "Falcon 9", "family": "Falcon", "full_name": "Falcon 9 Block 5", "variant": "Block 5"}}, "mission": {"id": 6042, "name": "Crew-12", "description": "SpaceX Crew-12 is the twelfth crewed operational flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Human Exploration", "orbit": {"id": 8, "name": "Low Earth Orbit", "abbrev": "LEO"}}, "pad": {"id": 87, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/87/", "agency_id": null, "name": "Launch Complex 39A", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39#Launch_Pad_39A", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.60822681,-80.60428186", "latitude": "28.60822681", "longitude": "-80.60428186", "location": {"id": 27, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/27/", "name": "Kennedy Space Center, FL, USA", "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_27_20200803142447.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/New_York", "total_launch_count": 217, "total_landing_count": 0}, "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_87_20200803143537.jpg", "total_launch_count": 159, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 158}, "webcast_live": false, "image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/falcon2520925_image_20220603083029.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 5, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/5/", "name": "Commercial Crew Program", "description": "The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is a human spaceflight program operated by NASA, in association with American aerospace manufacturers Boeing and SpaceX.
